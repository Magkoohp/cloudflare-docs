## Using DevTools

When running your Worker locally using `wrangler dev`, you automatically have access to [Cloudflare's implementation](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/wrangler-devtools?cf_target_id=115890352C73E75FD7D837D0B8720E96) of [Chrome's DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview). This provides a wide variety to tools to help you debug your Worker when it is not running correctly.

:::note
Many users will have experience with Chrome's DevTools from frontend development. It is worth noting that these DevTools are being used with backend Worker code and _not_ any client-side Javascript you may be shipping to the end user.

## Opening DevTools

To get started, run your Worker in development mode with `wrangler dev`, then open the DevTools by hitting <kbd>d</kbd> from within you terminal. This will open the DevTools in a browser window. Now, when you access your worker locally, it can be debugged and profiled via this DevTool instance.

Alternatively, both the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and the [Worker's Playground](https://workers.cloudflare.com/playground) include the developer tools in their UI.

## DevTool use cases

DevTools can be used in a variety of situations. For more information, see the documentation:

- [Debugging code via break points and logging](/workers/observability/dev-tools/breakpoints/)
- [Profiling CPU usage](/workers/observability/dev-tools/cpu-usage/)
- [Addressing out of memory (OOM) errors](/workers/observability/dev-tools/memory-usage/)
